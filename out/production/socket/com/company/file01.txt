Kazakhstan is in the 9th place by territory and located in Central Asia, and also has access to the Caspian and the Aral Sea where a huge amount of oil has. The neighbors that Kazakhstan has connect are China, Kyrgyzstan, Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan and the Russian Federation. In addition, with all these countries Kazakhstan has good relationships in different spheres. As I mentioned above from the moment when Kazakhstan got independence there were a lot of changes, for example, whether before the capital was Almaty then from 1997 the capital of Kazakhstan became Astana. Today Astana is one of the biggest and beautiful cities that attract many tourists to visit Kazakhstan. Talking about language that official is definitely Kazakh and also Russian language is quite widespread that many people can speak free. Furthermore, Kazakhstan possesses a rich selection of mineral reserves as well as numerous oil and gas fields. Kazakhstan’s strategic location in Eurasia has important implications on the country’s economy, politics, and culture which collectively create a favorable business environment for multinational companies. The factors that I would like to write are economic, legal and political.
